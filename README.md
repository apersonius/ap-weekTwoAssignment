# <Abigail Personius Portfolia - Week Two Assignment>

## Portfolia (Bootcamp Week Two Assignment)

I was given an assignment to create a professional portfolio. I wrote both the HTML and CSS from scratch using features to make the web page responsive. I added links to my previous projects and left placeholders for future projects as well as linking current resume and LinkedIn profile.
